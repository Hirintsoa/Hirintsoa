### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Throughout my career, I learned how to adapt the software development based on the product scope and the end users needs.

- First, my Fullstack Developer role where I created various web apps and APIs for worldwide clients looking for outsourcing helped me on understanding the client expectations.
- Then, as a Data Engineer, I focused more on in-depth backend engineering like big data processing, complex software testing and high scalability.
- Finally, after almost two years as a freelance Software Developer, I have been working mostly on maintenance and refactoring various projects; this taught me more about system design and software architecture pitfalls.
